ðŸª‚ Project Overview  :

This project simulates a skydiver jumping from a helicopter, with accurate physics for gravity, drag, and lift. Users can deploy different parachute types, adjust aerodynamic parameters, and observe real-time effects through a dynamic HUD. The environment includes animated models, trees, houses, and clouds for immersive visuals.

ðŸš€ Features  :

 Physics-based skydiving with drag, lift, and gravity  
 Two parachute types: circular and lifting  
 Real-time HUD showing forces, velocity, and altitude  
 Interactive controls for pitch, yaw, wind, and parachute tension  
 Procedural environment with trees, houses, and clouds  
 Smooth camera transitions and manual control mode
